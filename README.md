You can find the code that performs the experiments presented in the report in the following url:
https://github.com/dimter/cs-7641-unsupervised-learning

Please clone the repository and then follow the steps:
Install the necessary libraries:
1) Install python3
2) Install pipenv (https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/)
3) Run pipenv shell
4) Run pipenv install

The experiments are performed by two files:
Wine Quality dataset: wine-analysis.ipynb
Brease Cancer dataset: breast-cancer-analysis.ipynb

Both files are Jupyter Notebooks. Here you can find information on how to run Jupyter notebooks: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-jupyter-notebook-with-python-3-on-ubuntu-18-04

Once you open each notebook, please run all modules in order to perform all experiments.

The above command will run all experiments included in the report. Results are stored in the results folder.
